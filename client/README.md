# Client

This subproject contains the web client developed in TypeScript using React.

## Getting Started

First up, you need a nodejs installation. 
This was tested under v14 and 17, so any recent stable version should be fine. 


## Build and Run Locally

In the client directory, run:

### `npm install`

to install package dependencies, then 

### `npm start`

to build and run the app in the development mode.
The browser will be automatically launched under [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).

Of course the server backend must be running first, listening on [http://localhost:9100](http://localhost:9100)

### Developing

There is nothing really special required here - you can modify the client using any javascript/typescript enabled IDE, or even a text editor if that's your style. Client tested a little on chrome, should be fine on other modern browsers, but mileage may vary.
